# Overview

The U.S. Navy captured over 330,000 single frame trimetrogon images starting in 1946. This project provides a way to automatically download the public single frame images from the (Polar Geospatial Center)[https://www.pgc.umn.edu/data/aerial/] and stitch them into videos using sequential frames.
